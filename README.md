## Configuration

I added a `getTask` helper which fetches the daily challenge input data. It is possible by using the `session` cookie of your personal account. The environment varialbe `SESSION` is used as session cookie (`.env` is supported).

## Run

You can run each task by running `node <task>`.

Example:

`node day1.mjs`
